Overview: The purpose of this analysis was to figure out whether a charity was to be successful or not by using a binary classifier that we created. 

Results: With 3 attempts I was not able to return a predictive accuracy higher than 75%. First attempt I used 2 hidden notes with relu activations and 10 epochs. Second attempt, added a 3rd hidden note with same relu activation. Third attempt, kept 3 hidden nodes but used selu activation. All yielding with approx 73% accuracy. 

What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? 

    Used the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column as the target for the models.

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? 

    Used the 'CLASSIFICATION', 'APPLICATION_TYPE' columns for features on the models.

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? 

    'EIN', 'NAME' were removed from the input data because they were of no value to the data.

Summary: To achieve the desired 75% predictive accuracy we could add more nodes, layers, trim the data more, or run more epochs.
